# WIA1002 Data Structure (University of Malaya)

This repository contains materials related to the course **WIA1002 Data Structure**, offered at the University of Malaya.

This course introduces fundamental data structures used in computer science. These include both linear structures, such as arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists, as well as non-linear structures like trees and graphs. The course emphasizes an object-oriented approach to data structure design, focusing on abstract data types (ADTs), encapsulation, and modular implementation. Students will learn how to manipulate these structures using arrays, pointers, and lists to perform operations such as searching, insertion, deletion, and traversal.
